# 2023 Solutions in golang

Each day is represented as seperate folder. `common` folder contains utility functions that are used by all other problems.

## How to run?
From the root folder of go module (2023/golang) run the the problem in following way:
 - ```go run dayXX/main.go 1``` - first task of the day
 - ```go run dayXX/main.go 2``` - second task of the day

 Input files must be located in the day's folder and be named as `input` (e.g. `day04/input`)

 ### Note
 Take into account that some problems are input data specific. They work on my input data but may not work on yours. Maybe there is some general algo to overcome this, but I didn't want to spend much time on that
